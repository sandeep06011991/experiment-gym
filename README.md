## Introduction

Repository contains tools required to test various hypothesis.
Components which I will expect will reused will have unit tests

## Current sprint
--> Come closer to the single threaded version of the baseline.

1. Finish Square and capture measurements (Start 2:17)
2. Do experiment measuring cost of division with and without powers of 2.
3. Transfer BitMatrix computation

## EXPERIMENTS TO DO TOMORROW

1. Cost of BitMatrix construction should be reasonable
2. Square Matrix computation.

## Folder structure

1. Folders contain testable modules
2. Experiments in a seperate section
3. Modules tested and should contain unit tests

## TODO

2. Can I built bit Maps at that speed.
3. Evaluate batched intersections

## Notes

1. The difference between triangle evaluation and bitMapping should not be so high.

## Low Priority

1. Shift headers to include folder
