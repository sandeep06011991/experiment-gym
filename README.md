## Introduction

Repository contains tools required to test various hypothesis.
Components which I will expect will reused will have unit tests

## Current Sprint

1. Fix BUG in using a bitMatrix.
2. Evaluate possible causes of slow down.
3. Speed-up.


## EXPERIMENTS TO DO TOMORROW

1. Cost of BitMatrix construction should be reasonable
2. Square Matrix computation.

## Folder structure

1. Folders contain testable modules
2. Experiments in a seperate section
3. Modules tested and should contain unit tests

## TODO

2. Can I built bit Maps at that speed.
3. Evaluate batched intersections

## Notes

1. The difference between triangle evaluation and bitMapping should not be so high.

## Low Priority

1. Shift headers to include folder
