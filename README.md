## Introduction

Repository contains tools required to test various hypothesis.
Components which I will expect will reused will have unit tests

## Folder structure

1. Folders contain testable modules
2. Experiments in a seperate section
3. Modules tested and should contain unit tests

## TODO

1. Configure unit tests and change to more moduler architecture [When Tired]
2. Can I built bit Maps at that speed.
3. Evaluate batched intersections

## Notes

1. The difference between triangle evaluation and bitMapping should not be so high.

## Low Priority

1. Shift headers to include folder
